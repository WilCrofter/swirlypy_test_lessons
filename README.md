Swirlypy Test Lessons
=====================

*Experimental lessons for [swirlypy](https://github.com/SashaCrofter/swirlypy), a Python implementation of [swirl](http://swirlstats.com/faq.html)*

In perhaps the autumn of 2013, the swirl developers speculated that versions of swirl would be possible in languages other than [R](http://www.r-project.org/). In July of 2014, [SashaCrofter](https://github.com/SashaCrofter) demonstrated that swirl's core functions could be replicated in Python. The result is an interactive learning tool which, among other things, can drop the user into a Python shell and test any command he or she enters, providing hints and retries for incorrect answers. As with the R original, the platform can be extended, and instructional material is relatively easy to produce using simple [yaml](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaml) text.

R being primarily a programming language for statistics, [swirl course content](https://github.com/swirl_courses) concentrates in that area and provides particular support to the Johns Hopkins [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1) at Coursera. Python is far less specialized and many interactive tools for learning the language already exist, so it is not clear what topics swirlypy should cover.

This repository is likely to focus on swirlypy's technical capabilities, providing examples of how this, that, and the other thing might be done.
